#basic Spotify application

this app  let a user search for an artist to
retrieve information about his/her albums.
i used React js version 18.2.0 to build this app.
I used useContext hook and make it a store for the user's token , the token will be expires after 1 hour , automatically the app logged out and the user
should be login again .
about the artist's rating i don't know on what is based (popularity does not worked with me), for that i Divided the popularity on random number "15" (popularity/15)
to get an dummy rating number.
